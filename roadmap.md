    - Homepage (Value Proposition, CTAs, Testimonials).  
    - Booking System (Route selection, time slots, seat availability).  
    - User Dashboard (Booking history, cancellations).  
    - Information Pages (FAQs, Safety, Routes).  
  - Develop high-fidelity designs with tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

#### **Phase 2: Development**
- **2.1 Setup Development Environment**  
  - Use a modern framework like **React.js**, **Vue.js**, or **Angular**.  
  - Set up project scaffolding with tools like Create React App or Vue CLI.  

- **2.2 Implement Core Pages**  
  - **Homepage**:  
    - Add clear navigation, CTAs, and a “How It Works” section.  
    - Include testimonial and trust element sections.  
  - **Booking System**:  
    - Create forms for route and time selection with dynamic dropdowns.  
    - Display seat availability in real-time (integrate with backend API).  
    - Add payment selection and confirmation modals.  
  - **User Dashboard**:  
    - Implement tabs for upcoming/past bookings, receipts, and referral codes.  

- **2.3 Responsive Design**  
  - Ensure layouts are responsive using CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**.  
  - Test for mobile-first compatibility.  

- **2.4 Testing**  
  - Use tools like **Storybook** for component testing.  
  - Perform browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).  

#### **Phase 3: Deployment**  
- Deploy the frontend to a hosting service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS S3**.

### **Roadmap for Backend Development (Python-Based)**  

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Architecture**  
- **1.1 Define Backend Requirements**  
  - Core functionality: Booking management, seat availability updates, notifications, user authentication.  
  - APIs: For real-time seat availability, user data management, and payment processing.  
  - Ensure the system is scalable and secure.  

- **1.2 Choose Tech Stack**  
  - **Language**: Python.  
  - **Framework**: Django (for a full-stack approach) or Flask/FastAPI (for lightweight, API-focused development).  
  - **Database**:  
    - **PostgreSQL**: For structured data like bookings and user details.  
    - **Redis**: For caching real-time data (e.g., seat availability).  
  - **Task Queue**: Celery with RabbitMQ or Redis for handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending notifications).  
  - **Hosting**: AWS EC2, Heroku, or Google Cloud Platform.  

- **1.3 Database Design**  
  - Design schema/tables:  
    - **Users**: Name, email, phone, gender, password (hashed), referral code.  
    - **Rides**: Route, time slots, seat availability, price, status (active/completed).  
    - **Bookings**: User ID, ride ID, number of seats, payment status, booking timestamp.

#### **Phase 2: Core Backend Development**  

##### **2.1 User Authentication**  
- Implement sign-up/login functionality using **Django Authentication** or a custom JWT-based system (e.g., PyJWT).  
- Use bcrypt or Django’s built-in password hashing for secure user authentication.  
- Provide endpoints for:  
  - Sign-up.  
  - Login.  
  - Password reset (email-based).  

##### **2.2 Booking Management**  
- Develop APIs for booking features:  
  - **Fetch Available Rides**: Query the database for available routes, time slots, and seat counts.  
  - **Create Booking**: Reserve seats and deduct availability in real-time.  
  - **Cancel Booking**: Update seat availability and handle refund workflows.  
  - **Modify Booking**: Allow users to reschedule rides if policy allows.  

##### **2.3 Notifications & Updates**  
- Use **Twilio** or **SendGrid** for email/SMS notifications.  
- Configure Celery to handle asynchronous tasks for:  
  - Sending booking confirmations.  
  - Sending reminders before rides.  
  - Broadcasting updates in case of delays or changes.  

##### **2.4 Payment Integration**  
- Integrate payment gateways like **Razorpay**, **Stripe**, or **PayPal** using their Python SDKs.  
- Implement payment-related endpoints:  
  - **Initiate Payment**: Generate a payment link or handle in-app payments.  
  - **Verify Payment**: Ensure transactions are completed before confirming bookings.  
  - **Refund Handling**: Automate refunds based on the cancellation policy.  

##### **2.5 Admin Dashboard API**  
- Build backend APIs for admin tasks:  
  - **View Bookings**: Query and display booking data.  
  - **Manage Rides**: Update seat availability, create new routes, and deactivate rides.  
  - **Generate Reports**: Provide revenue insights, usage statistics, and feedback summaries.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing**  

##### **3.1 Unit Testing**  
- Write unit tests for all core APIs using **Pytest** or Django’s testing framework.  
- Test booking logic, authentication workflows, and notifications.  

##### **3.2 Integration Testing**  
- Test API interactions with frontend or Postman/Swagger for end-to-end validation.  
- Verify real-time updates like seat availability and booking status.  

##### **3.3 Security Testing**  
- Ensure security for sensitive endpoints (e.g., authentication and payments) using:  
  - HTTPS for secure API communication.  
  - Token-based authentication for APIs.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Deployment**  
- **4.1 Containerization**  
  - Use Docker to create containers for the backend and its dependencies.  
- **4.2 Deployment on Cloud**  
  - Deploy the backend on **AWS EC2**, **Google Cloud**, or **Heroku**.  
  - Configure database hosting using **AWS RDS** or **Google Cloud SQL**.  

##### **4.3 CI/CD**  
- Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Optimization & Monitoring**  
- **5.1 Performance Optimization**  
  - Use **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** for serving the backend with better concurrency.  
  - Set up caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like routes and seat availability.  

- **5.2 Monitoring & Logging**  
  - Use tools like **Sentry** or **Prometheus** for error tracking and performance monitoring.  
  - Implement structured logging using **Loguru** or **Python’s logging module**.  

---

### **Deliverables**  
- RESTful API endpoints for all functionalities.  
- Backend integrated with payment and notification services.  
- Deployed backend with a scalable and secure infrastructure.  

This roadmap ensures a robust Python-based backend tailored to the specific requirements of your service.

### **Integration Plan**
- Test communication between frontend and backend using APIs.  
- Validate real-time data (e.g., seat availability, booking updates).  
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure a seamless user experience.  

This phased roadmap ensures clarity and efficiency in developing the frontend and backend while prioritizing the needs of your target audience.

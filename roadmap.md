### **Roadmap for Frontend Development**

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**
- **1.1 Requirements Gathering**  
  - List all frontend features (e.g., booking form, seat availability display, user dashboard).  
  - Prioritize responsive design for mobile users.  

- **1.2 UI/UX Design**  
  - Create wireframes for:  
    - Homepage (Value Proposition, CTAs, Testimonials).  
    - Booking System (Route selection, time slots, seat availability).  
    - User Dashboard (Booking history, cancellations).  
    - Information Pages (FAQs, Safety, Routes).  
  - Develop high-fidelity designs with tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

#### **Phase 2: Development**
- **2.1 Setup Development Environment**  
  - Use a modern framework like **React.js**, **Vue.js**, or **Angular**.  
  - Set up project scaffolding with tools like Create React App or Vue CLI.  

- **2.2 Implement Core Pages**  
  - **Homepage**:  
    - Add clear navigation, CTAs, and a “How It Works” section.  
    - Include testimonial and trust element sections.  
  - **Booking System**:  
    - Create forms for route and time selection with dynamic dropdowns.  
    - Display seat availability in real-time (integrate with backend API).  
    - Add payment selection and confirmation modals.  
  - **User Dashboard**:  
    - Implement tabs for upcoming/past bookings, receipts, and referral codes.  

- **2.3 Responsive Design**  
  - Ensure layouts are responsive using CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**.  
  - Test for mobile-first compatibility.  

- **2.4 Testing**  
  - Use tools like **Storybook** for component testing.  
  - Perform browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).  

#### **Phase 3: Deployment**  
- Deploy the frontend to a hosting service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS S3**.

### **Roadmap for Backend Development**

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Architecture**
- **1.1 Define Backend Requirements**  
  - Core functionality: Booking management, seat availability updates, notifications, user authentication.  
  - APIs: For real-time seat availability, payment processing, and user data.  

- **1.2 Choose Tech Stack**  
  - Language: **Node.js** or **Python (Django/Flask)**.  
  - Database: **MongoDB** (NoSQL for dynamic data) or **PostgreSQL** (for structured data).  
  - Hosting: **AWS EC2**, **Heroku**, or **Google Cloud Platform**.  

- **1.3 Database Design**  
  - Tables/Collections:  
    - Users: Name, email, phone, gender, referral code.  
    - Rides: Route, time slots, availability, price.  
    - Bookings: User ID, ride ID, seat count, payment status.  

#### **Phase 2: API Development**
- **2.1 User Authentication**  
  - Implement sign-up/login using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or OAuth.  
  - Secure sensitive data with encryption (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).  

- **2.2 Booking Management**  
  - Create APIs for:  
    - Fetching available routes and time slots.  
    - Updating seat availability after booking.  
    - Cancelling or rescheduling bookings.  

- **2.3 Notifications & Updates**  
  - Use services like **Twilio** for SMS/email notifications.  
  - APIs for sending booking confirmation and reminders.  

- **2.4 Payment Integration**  
  - Integrate with payment gateways like **Razorpay**, **Stripe**, or **PayPal**.  
  - APIs for processing payments and handling refunds.  

#### **Phase 3: Admin Dashboard (Backend)**  
- **3.1 Build Admin Features**  
  - APIs for:  
    - Viewing and managing bookings.  
    - Updating ride availability and prices.  
    - Generating reports on revenue and user feedback.  

#### **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
- **4.1 Testing**  
  - Unit testing: Use tools like **Mocha**, **Jest**, or **Pytest**.  
  - API testing: Use tools like **Postman** or **Swagger**.  

- **4.2 Deployment**  
  - Use **Docker** for containerization.  
  - Deploy on cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **DigitalOcean**.  

---

### **Integration Plan**
- Test communication between frontend and backend using APIs.  
- Validate real-time data (e.g., seat availability, booking updates).  
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure a seamless user experience.  

This phased roadmap ensures clarity and efficiency in developing the frontend and backend while prioritizing the needs of your target audience.
